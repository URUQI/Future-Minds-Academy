        <h3>Earliest Inhabitants</h3>
        <p>The earliest known inhabitants of the area lived around 9200 BC, based on evidence found throughout the area
            and
            especially at the much-studied Gault Archeological Site, north of the city.</p>

    <h4>Native Peoples</h4>

    <p>When Europeans arrived, the area was inhabited by the Tonkawa tribe. Comanches and Lipan Apaches also traveled in
        the region. Though they came into contact with Spanish explorers and missions, few settlements were established
        for several centuries.</p>

    <h5>Geographic Distinction</h5>

    <p>Austin is situated at the foot of the Balcones Escarpment, a long stable and inactive fault line, on the Colorado
        River. This fault divides the Hill Country to the West of Austin from the prairie land to the East.</p>
